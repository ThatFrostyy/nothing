# Upgrade Card Suggestions

Here are some ideas for new upgrade cards, including a new spawn mechanic for allied secondary weapons.

## New Upgrade Cards

### 1. Armory Drone (Legendary)
*   **Description:** "Spawns a friendly drone that periodically drops a random allied secondary weapon."
*   **Mechanics:**
    *   The drone would follow the player at a distance.
    *   Every 60 seconds, it would drop a weapon pickup for a random allied secondary weapon.
    *   The dropped weapon would have limited ammo.

### 2. Special Delivery (Epic)
*   **Description:** "Your next supply drop will contain an additional allied special weapon."
*   **Mechanics:**
    *   This is a single-use upgrade.
    *   The next time a supply drop enemy is defeated, it will drop its usual special weapon, plus one additional, randomly-selected allied special weapon.

### 3. Weapon Scavenger (Rare)
*   **Description:** "Increases the chance of finding allied secondary weapons in crates."
*   **Mechanics:**
    *   Each stack of this upgrade would increase the probability of a weapon crate containing an allied secondary weapon by 10%.

### 4. Allied Cache (Uncommon)
*   **Description:** "Spawns a cache containing a random allied secondary weapon."
*   **Mechanics:**
    *   This is a single-use upgrade.
    *   Immediately upon selection, a weapon crate spawns near the player, guaranteed to contain a random allied secondary weapon.

## New Spawn Mechanic: Contraband Crate

Instead of having allied weapons drop from enemies, a new "Contraband" crate could be introduced.

*   **Appearance:** A different color or model to distinguish it from regular crates.
*   **Spawning:**
    *   Could spawn randomly on the map at a lower frequency than normal crates.
    *   Could be a rare drop from bosses.
    *   Could be the subject of a new "Smuggler" enemy type that tries to carry it off-screen.
*   **Contents:**
    *   Guaranteed to contain an allied secondary weapon.
    *   Could also have a chance to drop scrap or other resources.
